          <h2>Turin Bicycle</a></h2>
            <p>Turin started as a shop in the spring of 1965 on Sedgwick St., in Chicago.  Before opening on Sedgwick Turin had been an idea in Lionel Bottari's families basement in Pilsen.  Since 1965 we have had many locations and maybe 1000 people who have been part of Turin's staff family and many times that who have been part of the extended Turin family. We are now, in 2013, in Chicago, on Damen Ave and in Denver, on Lincoln.</p><p>Turin started as place where a community of people related by bicycles and various shades of social consciousness could both earn a living centered on their shared interest and do so in a way that had positive values. That was, and is still today, at it's core, a business that both staff and customer's could look forward to being engaged with. A place where people are happy to be, in their daily lives for staff and when ever they felt like it for customers and the extended Turin sometimes other, social and other equipment desires. This idea is as relevant and as much a part of Turin today as it was 48 years ago.</p><p>Turin is, above all, a composite of its staff. People who have cycling as a core part of their lives and who bring to or who have learned while here a high degree of technical skills to go along with the socially conscious and involved ethic that they had when they decided to become part of our community. Turin can only be as good as our staff. We are always looking at who we are and how we can improve so that we have the best staff that can be found at any bike shop, anywhere. Over our 49 years Turin has been owned in part by many people. Primarily Lionel Bottari and Roddy Green at the Sedgwick St. inception. Dan Joseph, Gary Page and Lee Katz from 1967 and Alan Fine since 1971. There have been at various times a small group of additional partners. The constants and continuing today are Lee and Alan. Ownership at Turin has evolved into (and maybe has always been) the responsibilities of trustees of an idea as much as the management of a business. It is our job as owners to be sure that Turin continues to provide an exceptional community asset to both staff, customers and our extended family.</p>
