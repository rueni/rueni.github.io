# Professional Website

The first project of WDI is to build a professional website.  I chose to build a website for a local cycling team and the steps taken to reach the end product are outlined below.

1. **Purpose:**<br>
The website will be used to promote Lifeline Racing.  It will provide information about the club, including the mission statement and a brief history of the organization.

2. **Concept:**<br>
The wireframing of the site was conceptualized and developed on mockingbird and diplayed below.  The site will developed on a single page and utilize jQuery and ajax to enhance user experience.

3. **Process:**<br>
The skeleton of the site will be laid out in HTML and CSS using Sass.

<h2>Project Scope</h2>
* Be hosted on Github Pages and be available to the web
* Contain an organization structure for HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Utilize vanilla Javascript OR jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Adequately represent your project scope; ie: a product website should contain product information.
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use 2 media queries/breakpoints for Responsive Design
* Use 1 $.ajax calls to external APIs and render data from them
