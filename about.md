Hello! My name is Chris Kim and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program and this site was created to showcase some of the work I've completed.  Before I embarked on this journey into web development, I worked in the finance industry and I bring with me, a wealth of experience in finance,  both in operations and management.

I am an avid cycling so when I'm not coding, I spend a lot of time riding my bike.  I also enjoy drinking a lot of coffee, eating, traveling and exploring the outdoors.
