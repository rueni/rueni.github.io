## Summary of Project

A RESTful API built on Rails with a database of Great Neighborhood Restaurants collected off of the LTH Forum website. Currently, the GNR list is managed on the forum and it can be somewhat difficult to navigate the list. This API was created to better manage the data on the site and to allow developers to build out applications using the database of restaurants on the list. As a bonus feature, I added a random restaurant 'roulette' button on the home page.
