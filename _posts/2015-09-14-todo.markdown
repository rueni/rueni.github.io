## Portfolio Requirements

It is the final 3 weeks of the 'in-class' portion of WDI, i.e. the independence section! During this section, you are to deliver a portfolio site complete with your pair programming project and the below listed applications. Each should be their own github repository.

## Classical MVC (Pair Programming)

- Sinatra or Rails
- Authentication + Single Model C.R.U.D.
- Use the Classic MVC pattern
- One-To-Many (Users have many x)
- ActiveRecord
- *Examples:*
  - ToDo App
  - Note App
  - Twitter Like App

## Sinatra or Express SPA -Revise first project

- A "Sign-Up" or "Contact Form" style application
- Must be responsive and tested on mobile phone(s)
- As a user, I can enter in my name, email, etc. so I can 'sign-up' to be contacted later
- Or I can send someone a message somehow.
- Utilize Mandrill or similar service to send emails to your clients

## API -> LTH Forum

- Use any framework/language of your choice to build an API!
- Sinatra, Express, Rails allowed. .NET, Django, others will be considered.
- We're going to build a RESTful API for a single model!
- You just need to serve data. No rendering anything.
- Don't give stangers create/update/delete access.
Test with CocoaRest / Postman
