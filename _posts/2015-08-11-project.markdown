## Summary of Project

This was our first foray into pair programming and to MVC design patterns.  Wishlist is a
user authenticated web application, that allows registered users to create a list of "wants" and "haves."
 The idea behind the application was to create a platform where users can transact with others based on
matching attributes of list items in the database.  The application features a PostgreSQL database
built on a Sinatra framework and allows for full CRUD functionality.  The matching of "wants" and "haves" will be incorporated into the second iteration of development.
