## Summary of Project

This is version 1.0 of a NodeJS web application using the Instagram API. This project was my introduction to consuming
data from other sources, as well as rendering it out on the front-end using AngularJS.  It features a search
query to allow the user to retrieve Instagram images based on a hashtag and it also fetches nearby
images from the Instagram server based on the users geolocation.
